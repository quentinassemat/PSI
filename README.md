# PSI
## Context
This project is part of my course at the Ecole Polytechnique, under the direction of Olivier Blazy, a member of the Grace team at INRIA. 
## Goal
The goal is to study the state of the art in the PSI problem, to realize some implementations in order to have also a practical approach of the problem, and potentially to propose some modifications of some existing protocols.
